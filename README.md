# CSC 510 Final Project: Connect 4 AI

## To do
- Think about heuristic options to measure how close or interesting a particular game state is. If this becomes too difficult, we could switch to a game where this is more easily defined (e.g. checkers).

## Heuristic Ideas
**Note:** we can combine multiple ideas into one heuristic
### Options to win
How many options does the player have of winning the game? -- might be expensive to compute
### Number of connected pieces
How many connected pieces does the player have?
